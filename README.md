# Canadian-Super-Store
Tableau Data Analysis/ Visualization Project

Scenario
Superstore is a famous retailer in Canada. They have expanded into the USA and their business model involves placing Sales Agents in every state in the USA. These sales agents are responsible for bringing in sales for the state that they are assigned to.
The Sales Manager wants a dashboard to track how Sales Agents are doing. She wants to be able to select a timeframe (e.g., January - March 2020) and track growth. Further, she wants a breakdown of sales per category (and possibly subcategory) as well as the top performing products.
You task is to design a dashboard in Tableau that satisfies the Sales Managerâ€™s desires.
